# UdacityProject---Data-Wrangling (Twitter Data)
Project 4 - Udacity Project: Data Wrangling with Python and Jupyter Notebooks

## Description

In this project, I will be using Python and jupiter notebooks and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources/formats, assess its quality/tidyness and then clean it.
The dataset that will be wrangled and analyzed is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_Rates (WeRateDogs).

## Steps:

Data is gathered from at least 3 different sources;  

a) One is a dataset that is given to me to be downloaded manually. 
b) Another should be downloaded programatically using a URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv.  
c) Additional data should be pulled using the JSON file from Twitter's API.  If there is a problem related with server, you can get it from Udacity documents.   

* Data is assessed, cleaned and tested.  
* Performed Visual and Programmatic assessment.  
* Detected quality issues and tidiness issues and documented.  
* Steps were defined to fix the issues and carried out.  
* Tests were done to make sure these issues have been resolved.  
* Data is exported to SQLite databse and CSV files.  
* Data is then Analyzed to find at least 3 findings.   
* Findings are documented in pdf file.  

## Submission:

* Project code will be performed within a jupyter notebook.  
* The wrangling steps (gather, assess, clean) are clearly identified.  
* Data must be gathered from at least three different sources.  
* Imported into separate pandas DataFrames at first.  
* Cleaned datasets must be stored as CSV or SQLite database.  
* Dataset must be analyzed to produce at least 3 separate insights.  
* Contains at least one labeled visualization.  
* The wrangling phase is documented in a concise PDF file.  
* The findings are placed in a report as a PDF as well.  
* Important files & Installation Notes.  

wrangling-act.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file which outlines each individual step during the wrangling process along with comments and markdown analysis of the assessment stages.
